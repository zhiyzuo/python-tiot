1,"Conference mining and expert finding are useful academic knowledge discovery problems from an academic recommendation point of view. Group level (GL) topic modeling can provide us with richer text semantics and relationships, which results in denser topics. And denser topics are more useful for academic discovery issues in contrast to Element level (EL) or Document level (DL) topic modeling, which produces sparser topics. Previous methods performed academic knowledge discovery by using network connectivity (only links not text of documents), keywords-based matching (no semantics) or by using semantics-based intrinsic structure of the words presented between documents (semantics at DL), while ignoring semantics-based intrinsic structure of the words and relationships between conferences (semantics at GL). In this paper, we consider semantics-based intrinsic structure of words and relationships presented in conferences (richer text semantics and relationships) by modeling from GL. We propose group topic modeling methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Detailed empirical evaluation shows that our proposed GL methods significantly outperformed DL methods for conference mining and expert finding problems",Group topic modeling for academic knowledge discovery,0,1300,1200,657,0,0,0,183,2010
2,"One of the major strengths of probabilistic topic modeling is the ability to reveal hidden relations via the analysis of co-occurrence patterns on dyadic observations, such as document-term pairs. However, in many practical settings, the extreme sparsity and volatility of co-occurrence patterns within the data, when the majority of terms appear in a single document, limits the applicability of topic models. In this paper, we propose an efficient topic modeling framework in the presence of volatile dyadic observations when direct topic modeling is infeasible. We show both theoretically and empirically that often-available unstructured and semantically-rich meta-data can serve as a link between dyadic sets, and can allow accurate and efficient inference. Our approach is general and can work with most latent variable models, which rely on stable dyadic data, such as pLSI, LDA, and GaP. Using transactional data from a major e-commerce site, we demonstrate the effectiveness as well as the applicability of our method in a personalized recommendation system for volatile items. Our experiments show that the proposed learning method outperforms the traditional LDA by capturing more persistent relations between dyadic sets of wide and practical significance. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",Topic modeling for personalized recommendation of volatile items,0,1413,1135,789,0,0,0,615,2010
3,"Complex networks are everywhere. The object-oriented software system is a typical example. Based on analyzing evolving structure of the Object-Oriented software systems, we consider accelerating growth of network as power-law growth, which can be easily generalized to real systems as better than linearly growing ones. For scale-free network with preferential linking and increasing links via a power law, we focus on exploring the generic mechanisms of scale-free behavior. We propose a scale-free model that can predict the emergence of scale-free behavior in good agreement with power-law growth and scale-free property, which excel the existing scale-free network models. Moreover, we use the obtained predictions to fit the degree distribution of software network describing scale-free structure with the accelerating growth. The combined analytical and numerical results indicate the emergence of a new set of model that considerably enhance our ability to characterize and model complex evolving networks, which can not only represent software system but also simulate other complex interactive systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks and so on.",A novel scale-free network model with accelerating growth,0,0,0,0,0,0,511,176,2015
4,"Pervasive computing is offering a level of personalized control over complex and distributed systems. We have designed a system using a communication network that displays a high degree of scale free behavior described by power law. Scale-free systems guarantee aggregation that is useful in building automation, sensors grid management and power generator grids. Synchronizability and stability are main problems of different processes. In order to keep a system stable and easy to manage is useful to have a scale-free structure. A mathematical model was used to define synchronizability criteria. At last, using aweighting scheme, the system was able to create scale-free networks with scale-free aggregates. The schema is activated when processes exchange run in the network. The design approach is valuable because it is one of the first attempts to use scale-free approach to design control systems. There are functional advantages of a scale free network topology. A scale-free network displays high degree of tolerance against random failures as only a few prominent hubs dominate their topology. However, vulnerability of hub is a risk to system reliability.",Scale-free networks of collaborative processes to design distributed control systems,0,0,0,0,0,1011,1055,138,2014
5,"A class of scale-free networks is used to model the very complex connectivity of the Internet. This connectivity at the same time favors the spreading of computer viruses. On the Internet, real data from computer virus infections are analyzed. The average lifetime and persistence of viral strains are observed. A model for the spreading of infections on scale-free networks is defined to find the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior.",Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks,0,0,0,0,0,667,687,138,2014
6,"Random networks with complex topology are common in Nature, describing systems as diverse as the world wide web or social and business networks. Recently, it has been demonstrated that most large networks for which topological information is available display scale-free features. Here we study the scaling properties of the recently introduced scale-free model, that can account for the observed power-law distribution of the connectivities. We develop a mean-field method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-field method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling",Mean-field theory for scale-free random networks,0,0,0,0,234,564,963,138,2013
7,"This paper discusses problems on scale-free network traffic, with the bandwidth considered as the delivering ability of links. Moreover, the traffic model of scale-free network is established, with the fixed bandwidth, which means the delivering ability of each link as a constant in the network. For better understanding traffic dynamic in real systems, the effects of bandwidth on the packet delivering of the traffic systems have been focus on. Meanwhile, some phenomena are found from the simulations, and the change of network load with different bandwidths is researched qualitatively in a 'tunable clustering coefficient' BA scale-free network and on the background of information traffic. The capacity of network load is higher in the network with the plenteous bandwidth, on the contrary, the capacity of network load degreases substantially induced by the bandwidth declining. In the light of the theory of complex network topology and traffic, the analytical explanations are provided on the change of the capacity of network load with the restriction of bandwidth",Study on scale-free network traffic with bandwidth of links,0,0,0,0,345,667,687,138,2013
8,"Probabilistic topic models were originally developed and utilized for document modeling and topic extraction in Information Retrieval. In this paper, we describe a new approach for automatic learning of terminological ontologies from text corpus based on such models. In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-document interpreted in terms of probability distributions. We propose two algorithms for learning terminological ontologies using the principle of topic relationship and exploiting information theory with the probabilistic topic models learned. Experiments with different model parameters were conducted and learned ontology statements were evaluated by the domain experts. We have also compared the results of our method with two existing concept hierarchy learning methods on the same data set. The study shows that our method outperforms other methods in terms of recall and precision measures. The precision level of the learned ontology is sufficient for it to be deployed for the purpose of browsing, navigation, and information search and retrieval in digital libraries.",Probabilistic topic models for learning terminological ontologies,0,0,874,541,0,0,0,615,2011
9,"We explore the utility of different types of topic models for retrieval purposes. Based on prior work, we describe several ways that topic models can be integrated into the retrieval process. We evaluate the effectiveness of different types of topic models within those retrieval approaches. We show that: (1) topic models are effective for document smoothing; (2) more rigorous topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation provide gains over cluster-based models; (3) more elaborate topic models that capture topic dependencies provide no additional gains; (4) smoothing documents by using their similar documents is as effective as smoothing them by using topic models; (5) doing query expansion should utilize topics discovered in the top feedback documents instead of coarse-grained topics from the whole corpus; (6) generally, incorporating topics in the feedback documents for building relevance models can benefit the performance more for queries that have more relevant documents.",A comparative study of utilizing topic models for information retrieval,0,0,0,443,0,0,0,615,2012
10,"Although fully generative models have been successfully used to model the contents of text documents, they are often awkward to apply to combinations of text data and document metadata. In this paper we propose a Dirichlet- multinomial regression (DMR) topic model that includes a log-linear prior on document-topic distributions that is a function of observed features of the document, such as author, publication venue, references, and dates. We show that by selecting appropriate features, DMR topic models can meet or exceed the performance of several previously published topic models designed for specific data.",Topic models conditioned on arbitrary features with Dirichlet-Multinomial regression,0,0,657,276,0,0,0,615,2011
