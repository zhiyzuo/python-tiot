"Perceived support from healthcare practitioners among adults with type 2 diabetes. Journal of Advanced Nursing 66(7), 1500-1509. Title.: Perceived support from healthcare practitioners among adults with type 2 diabetes. Aim.: This paper is a report of a study of how adults with type 2 diabetes perceive different attributes of support provided by healthcare practitioners and how various attributes of support can influence people's motivation to self-manage their disease. Background.: Motivational problems seem to be a major reason for poor diabetes management. According to well-known theories of motivation, expectations of being able to perform certain behaviours are a key element. Different attributes of support from healthcare practitioners are likely to influence such expectations. To date, no researchers have specifically examined how people with type 2 diabetes perceive different attributes of support from healthcare practitioners and how these may influence their motivation to manage their disease themselves. Methods.: A descriptive/explorative qualitative design and focus groups were used to collect data. The sample consisted of 19 adults with type 2 diabetes, and the data were collected in 2007 and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings.: Five themes were identified, reflecting perceived attributes of support from healthcare practitioners: (1) an empathetic approach, (2) practical advice and information, (3) involvement in decision-making, (4) accurate and individualized information and (5) ongoing group-based support. Conclusion.: Healthcare practitioners may strengthen the self-management motivation among adults with type 2 diabetes by enhancing expectations of being able to perform the necessary diabetes care, and through the provision of empathetic, individualized, practical and ongoing group-based support..

"One major concern with electronic healthcare data relates to preserving the privacy and confidentiality of such data. The recent Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 has established national standards for the protection of health information. The National Institutes of Health also requires healthcare researchers to share data regarding their subjects, but without compromising privacy or confidentiality. In this study, we develop a new technique that can be used to effectively mask healthcare data. The technique guarantees that the results of most (parametric) statistical analyses performed on the masked data will be identical to that perform on the original data. The application of the new technique will allow healthcare researchers and healthcare providers to share sensitive data without compromising privacy and confidentiality..

"Complex networks are everywhere. The object-oriented software system is a typical example. Based on analyzing evolving structure of the Object-Oriented software systems, we consider accelerating growth of network as power-law growth, which can be easily generalized to real systems as better than linearly growing ones. For scale-free network with preferential linking and increasing links via a power law, we focus on exploring the generic mechanisms of scale-free behavior. We propose a scale-free model that can predict the emergence of scale-free behavior in good agreement with power-law growth and scale-free property, which excel the existing scale-free network models. Moreover, we use the obtained predictions to fit the degree distribution of software network describing scale-free structure with the accelerating growth. The combined analytical and numerical results indicate the emergence of a new set of model that considerably enhance our ability to characterize and model complex evolving networks, which can not only represent software system but also simulate other complex interactive systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks and so on.. A novel scale-free network model with accelerating growth",
"Pervasive computing is offering a level of personalized control over complex and distributed systems. We have designed a system using a communication network that displays a high degree of scale free behavior described by power law. Scale-free systems guarantee aggregation that is useful in building automation, sensors grid management and power generator grids. Synchronizability and stability are main problems of different processes. In order to keep a system stable and easy to manage is useful to have a scale-free structure. A mathematical model was used to define synchronizability criteria. At last, using aweighting scheme, the system was able to create scale-free networks with scale-free aggregates. The schema is activated when processes exchange run in the network. The design approach is valuable because it is one of the first attempts to use scale-free approach to design control systems. There are functional advantages of a scale free network topology. A scale-free network displays high degree of tolerance against random failures as only a few prominent hubs dominate their topology. However, vulnerability of hub is a risk to system reliability.. Scale-free networks of collaborative processes to design distributed control systems",
"A class of scale-free networks is used to model the very complex connectivity of the Internet. This connectivity at the same time favors the spreading of computer viruses. On the Internet, real data from computer virus infections are analyzed. The average lifetime and persistence of viral strains are observed. A model for the spreading of infections on scale-free networks is defined to find the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior.. Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks",
"Random networks with complex topology are common in Nature, describing systems as diverse as the world wide web or social and business networks. Recently, it has been demonstrated that most large networks for which topological information is available display scale-free features. Here we study the scaling properties of the recently introduced scale-free model, that can account for the observed power-law distribution of the connectivities. We develop a mean-field method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-field method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling. Mean-field theory for scale-free random networks",
"This paper discusses problems on scale-free network traffic, with the bandwidth considered as the delivering ability of links. Moreover, the traffic model of scale-free network is established, with the fixed bandwidth, which means the delivering ability of each link as a constant in the network. For better understanding traffic dynamic in real systems, the effects of bandwidth on the packet delivering of the traffic systems have been focus on. Meanwhile, some phenomena are found from the simulations, and the change of network load with different bandwidths is researched qualitatively in a 'tunable clustering coefficient' BA scale-free network and on the background of information traffic. The capacity of network load is higher in the network with the plenteous bandwidth, on the contrary, the capacity of network load degreases substantially induced by the bandwidth declining. In the light of the theory of complex network topology and traffic, the analytical explanations are provided on the change of the capacity of network load with the restriction of bandwidth.

"Unsafe injection practices, including the re-use of unsterile needles and syringes, are commonplace in developing country health settings, and contribute substantially to the global burden of blood-borne viral disease. Unsafe injection practices place at risk not only patients, but also healthcare workers, who practice universal precautions inconsistently and are commonly exposed to blood in the course of their work. Global awareness of the link between unsafe injection practices and the burden of blood-borne viral disease was slow to emerge but has grown in the recent years. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Safe Injection Global Network (SIGN), which advocates a range of interventions for the promotion of injection safety. As well as exhorting healthcare workers to use a new needle and syringe for every injection, they should also be encouraged and supported to protect themselves from exposure to blood. It is argued here that promoting the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries is an essential and currently under-valued component of the response to the problem of unsafe injection practices. Protecting healthcare workers from occupational infection with blood-borne viruses has a range of potential benefits, including safer injection practices for patients and less discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. There is an urgent need for organisational commitment to the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries, along with the provision of training in injection safety and universal precautions, adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, and hepatitis B vaccination. Healthcare worker safety is a pre-requisite for injection safety in developing countries",
"Role of hand hygiene in healthcare-associated infection prevention. Healthcare workers' hands are the most common vehicle for the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens from patient to patient and within the healthcareenvironment. Hand hygiene is the leading measure for preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and reducing healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), but healthcareworker compliance with optimal practices remains low in most settings. This paper reviews factors influencing hand hygiene compliance, the impact of hand hygiene promotion on healthcare-associated pathogen cross-transmission and infection rates, and challenging issues related to the universal adoption of alcohol-based hand rub as a critical system change for successful promotion. Available evidence highlights the fact that multimodal intervention strategies lead to improved hand hygiene and a reduction in HCAI. However, further research is needed to evaluate the relative efficacy of each strategy component and to identify the most successful interventions, particularly in settings with limited resources. The main objective of the First Global Patient Safety Challenge, launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), is to achieve an improvement in hand hygiene practices worldwide with the ultimate goal of promoting a strong patient safety culture. We also report considerations and solutions resulting from the implementation of the multimodal strategy proposed in the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care.",
"The purpose of this study is to provide a critical review and synthesis of theoretical and research literature documenting the impact of avoidance on healthcare behaviors, identify the factors that influence healthcare avoidance and delay in the adult population, and propose a direction for future research. The Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Planned Behavior, Theory of Care-Seeking Behavior, the Transtheoretical Model, and the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use/Utilization are utilized to elaborate on the context within which individual intention to engage in healthcare behaviors occurs. Research literature on the concept of healthcare avoidance obtained by using computerized searches of CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYCH INFO, and HAPI databases, from 1995 to 2007, were reviewed. Studies were organized by professional disciplines. Healthcare avoidance is a common and highly variable experience. Multiple administrative, demographic, personal, and provider factors are related to healthcare avoidance, for example, distrust of providers and/or the science community, health beliefs, insurance status, or socioeconomic/income level. Although the concept is recognized by multiple disciplines, limited research studies address its impact on healthcare decision making. More systematic research is needed to determine correlates of healthcare avoidance. Such studies will help investigators identify patients at risk for avoidant behaviors and provide the basis for health-promoting interventions. Methodological challenges include identification of characteristics of individuals and environments that hinder healthcare behaviors, as well as, the complexity of measuring healthcare avoidance. Studies need to systematically explore the influence of avoidance behaviors on specific healthcare populations at risk. Healthcare avoidance: A critical review",
