1,"Conference mining and expert finding are useful academic knowledge discovery problems from an academic recommendation point of view. Group level (GL) topic modeling can provide us with richer text semantics and relationships, which results in denser topics. And denser topics are more useful for academic discovery issues in contrast to Element level (EL) or Document level (DL) topic modeling, which produces sparser topics. Previous methods performed academic knowledge discovery by using network connectivity (only links not text of documents), keywords-based matching (no semantics) or by using semantics-based intrinsic structure of the words presented between documents (semantics at DL), while ignoring semantics-based intrinsic structure of the words and relationships between conferences (semantics at GL). In this paper, we consider semantics-based intrinsic structure of words and relationships presented in conferences (richer text semantics and relationships) by modeling from GL. We propose group topic modeling methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Detailed empirical evaluation shows that our proposed GL methods significantly outperformed DL methods for conference mining and expert finding problems",Group topic modeling for academic knowledge discovery,0,2030,1200,657,265,125,20,183,1996
2,"One of the major strengths of probabilistic topic modeling is the ability to reveal hidden relations via the analysis of co-occurrence patterns on dyadic observations, such as document-term pairs. However, in many practical settings, the extreme sparsity and volatility of co-occurrence patterns within the data, when the majority of terms appear in a single document, limits the applicability of topic models. In this paper, we propose an efficient topic modeling framework in the presence of volatile dyadic observations when direct topic modeling is infeasible. We show both theoretically and empirically that often-available unstructured and semantically-rich meta-data can serve as a link between dyadic sets, and can allow accurate and efficient inference. Our approach is general and can work with most latent variable models, which rely on stable dyadic data, such as pLSI, LDA, and GaP. Using transactional data from a major e-commerce site, we demonstrate the effectiveness as well as the applicability of our method in a personalized recommendation system for volatile items. Our experiments show that the proposed learning method outperforms the traditional LDA by capturing more persistent relations between dyadic sets of wide and practical significance. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",Topic modeling for personalized recommendation of volatile items,0,1413,1135,789,313,200,10,615,2001
3,"Complex networks are everywhere. The object-oriented software system is a typical example. Based on analyzing evolving structure of the Object-Oriented software systems, we consider accelerating growth of network as power-law growth, which can be easily generalized to real systems as better than linearly growing ones. For scale-free network with preferential linking and increasing links via a power law, we focus on exploring the generic mechanisms of scale-free behavior. We propose a scale-free model that can predict the emergence of scale-free behavior in good agreement with power-law growth and scale-free property, which excel the existing scale-free network models. Moreover, we use the obtained predictions to fit the degree distribution of software network describing scale-free structure with the accelerating growth. The combined analytical and numerical results indicate the emergence of a new set of model that considerably enhance our ability to characterize and model complex evolving networks, which can not only represent software system but also simulate other complex interactive systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks and so on.",A novel scale-free network model with accelerating growth,0,156,488,509,1200,1496,2000,176,2002
4,"Pervasive computing is offering a level of personalized control over complex and distributed systems. We have designed a system using a communication network that displays a high degree of scale free behavior described by power law. Scale-free systems guarantee aggregation that is useful in building automation, sensors grid management and power generator grids. Synchronizability and stability are main problems of different processes. In order to keep a system stable and easy to manage is useful to have a scale-free structure. A mathematical model was used to define synchronizability criteria. At last, using aweighting scheme, the system was able to create scale-free networks with scale-free aggregates. The schema is activated when processes exchange run in the network. The design approach is valuable because it is one of the first attempts to use scale-free approach to design control systems. There are functional advantages of a scale free network topology. A scale-free network displays high degree of tolerance against random failures as only a few prominent hubs dominate their topology. However, vulnerability of hub is a risk to system reliability.",Scale-free networks of collaborative processes to design distributed control systems,0,67,345,778,1007,1011,1055,138,2002
