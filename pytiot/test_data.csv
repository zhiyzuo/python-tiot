$0030211964$,"Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.  1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers,.",Bagging predictors,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,20,39,49,69,122,163,230,281,368,452,441,521,557,608,636,710,739,804,759,183,1996
$0035478854$,"Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",Random forests,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,28,67,111,229,320,455,670,827,1135,1413,1746,2316,2551,615,2001
$0036013593$,"Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.",Statistical mechanics of complex networks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,184,391,555,678,784,775,905,842,862,858,811,840,733,176,2002
$0037062448$,"A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.",Community structure in social and biological networks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,16,47,66,116,211,222,317,394,526,571,625,714,559,138,2002
$0038483826$,"Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.",Emergence of scaling in random networks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,95,170,259,401,533,753,982,1014,1242,1264,1329,1486,1496,1599,1373,313,1999
$18744389789$,The study was conducted to determine the mixing patterns in a variety of networks. It was observed that the networks percolate more easily if they were assortive and that they were also more robust to vertex removal. A network showed assortative mixing if the nodes in the networks that possessed many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections.,Assortative mixing in networks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,57,64,96,143,129,151,193,191,200,181,221,182,47,2002
